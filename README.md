## Why MangoFetch?

Most downloaders are either too bloated or too fragile. **MangoFetch** is neither. It's a high-performance download engine wrapped in a minimalist, brutalist terminal interface. 

Built with **Tokio** for high-concurrency and **Reqwest** for rock-solid networking, it handles everything from a single YouTube short to massive batch archival tasks without breaking a sweat.

### The Good Stuff:
- **🚀 Zero Bloat:** Instant startup, minimal memory footprint.
- **⚡ Async Everything:** Powered by Rust's async runtime.
- **🛠️ Self-Healing:** Automatically manages `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` dependencies.
- **🎨 Brutalist UI:** Information-dense, distraction-free progress tracking.
- **📦 Platform Agnostic:** 1000+ sites supported via the core engine + native extractors for the big players.
- **🔌 SDK Ready:** Extend it with your own Rust plugins.
